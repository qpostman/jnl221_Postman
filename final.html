			<h3> A Look Into Modern Dating</h3>
			<p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial;"> The dating landscape has fundamentally changed over the last 20 years. Over <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/7443/online-dating/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20number%20of,users%20peaked%20at%2026.6%20million."> 380 million people use online dating apps</a> like Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/02/02 the-who-where-and-why-of-online-dating-in-the-u-s/"> meet </a> a long term partner or spouse, date casually, have casual sex, and make new friends. </p>
			<p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial;"> According to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/therelationshipxpert/"> Jaime Bronstein</a>, a relationship therapist and coach, fewer people go to places like bars to meet people because of the convenience of dating apps. </p>
			<p style="font-size:18px; font-family: Arial;"> However, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/08/20/nearly-half-of-u-s-adults-say-dating-has-gotten-harder-for-most-people-in-the-last-10-years/">a Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2019</a> showed 75% of daters found it very/somewhat difficult to find people to date in the previous year. In the five years since, countless dating app users have experienced "dating app fatigue" according to Bronstein.</p>

			<p style="font-size: 18px; font-family:Arial;"> <q>People aren't going to the bars because of the apps and people are complaining about the apps,</q> Bronstein said. <q>It's just this big cycle. People are really craving a more curated way to meet people.</q> </p>
			<p style="font-size: 18px; font-family:Arial;"> From 2002 to 2004, Columbia Business School professors Ray Fisman and Sheen Iyengar collected date from Columbia University graduate students who attended a speed dating event. Each attendee was given four minutes on a date with the opposite sex and then asked to rate their partner on attributes such as attractiveness and intelligence along with complete a questionnaire entailing items such as dating frequency, primary goal of attending speed dating, age, gender and race. </p>

			<h3>Attractiveness</h3>
			<p style = "font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial;"> Each attendee ranked their date's attractiveness on a scale from one to 10 after going on a data. According to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/dating-and-mating/201701/why-physical-attraction-matters-and-when-it-might-not">Psychology Today</a>, physical attractiveness is the first element driving individuals toward a partner and is a viable reason for continuing to puruse a partner.</p>
			<p style="font-size:18px; font-family: Arial;"> <q>Attraction is speed dating No.1,</q> Bronstein said.</p>
			<p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial;"> Those who found their data unattractive (zero to three) had a less than 3% chance of finding a match. Only nine attendees found a match with a partner they saw as unattractive. If the attendee found their partner slightly attractive (three to six), their chances of finding a match skyrocketed by over 150%. </p>

				</script>
			<p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial;"> According to the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4873083/#:~:text=Inferences%20on%20Personality:%20What%20is%20Beautiful%20is%20Good&text=Physical%20attractiveness%20has%20been%20shown,strong%20inferences%20of%20personality%20goodness.">National Library of Medicine</a>, physical attractiveness offers a halo effect. A halo effect is when a person's overall judgement is based on a single trait, often leading to biased judgements. </p>
			<p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial;"> For example, individuals assume a correlation between positive qualities like kidness, personality, happiness, and physical attractiveness. Individuals also consciously or unconsciously employ a cognitive bias called <q>What is beautiful is good</q> to associate beauty with positive qualities.</p>
			<p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial;"> Over 85% of individuals who found a match described their partner as attractive (six to nine) or very attractive (nine to 10). One attendee ranked their partner's attractiveness on a scale of one to 10 with a 10. and matched with their partner. </p>
